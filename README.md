This JavaScript project features a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users interact with a web interface to input numbers and select operations. The calculator supports decimal numbers and includes functionality to clear the current input, delete the last digit, and compute the result of the arithmetic expression. The code is structured around a Calculator class, which handles the calculator's logic and state, and updates the display based on user interactions with buttons on the webpage. This project is ideal for those looking to understand how to build interactive web applications with JavaScript.
